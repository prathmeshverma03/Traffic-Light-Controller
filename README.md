# Traffic-Light-Control-System
An efficient traffic management system utilizing an Arduino Nano microcontroller, IR sensors, and sound detection sensors to mimic standard traffic lights.

Overview:

This Traffic Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to efficiently regulate traffic flow at intersections while prioritizing emergency vehicle passage. It combines Arduino Nano microcontrollers, IR sensors, and sound detection sensors to simulate standard traffic lights with added safety-conscious features.

Features:

Traffic Light Simulation: The system accurately mimics the operation of standard traffic lights, ensuring a familiar and safe traffic control experience.

Emergency Vehicle Priority: In emergency situations, such as when an ambulance, fire truck, or police vehicle approaches the intersection, the system automatically grants them priority passage by changing the traffic lights to allow their immediate passage.

Real-time Sensor Data: The system constantly collects data from IR sensors and sound detection sensors to assess traffic conditions. This data is used to dynamically adjust traffic light timings for optimal traffic flow.

Congestion Reduction: By using real-time sensor data, the system intelligently manages traffic light timings to minimize congestion, reducing delays for all vehicles and improving overall traffic efficiency.
Components:

Arduino Nano Microcontroller: The brain of the system, responsible for processing sensor data and controlling the traffic lights.

IR Sensors: Detect the presence of vehicles waiting at the intersection.

Sound Detection Sensors: Recognize emergency sirens to trigger priority passage for emergency vehicles.


Usage:

Installation: Set up the IR sensors and sound detection sensors at the intersection according to the provided guidelines.

Programming: Upload the provided Arduino code to the Arduino Nano microcontroller.

Operation: The system will now autonomously manage traffic flow. In the event of an emergency vehicle approach, the system will ensure their prompt passage.

Benefits:

Improved traffic management and reduced congestion.
Enhanced safety with priority passage for emergency vehicles.
Adaptable to various intersection types and traffic conditions.
Demonstrates strong problem-solving skills by utilizing real-time sensor data.
